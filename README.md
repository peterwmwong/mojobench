A quick look at the Mojo Tail Call Optimization and Elimination performance claims in [Mojo vs. Rust: is Mojo ðŸ”¥ faster than Rust ðŸ¦€ ?](https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240215183318/https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust))

> Note: Modular seems to have revised the post's benchmark, [originally](https://web.archive.org/web/20240212205752/https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust) a `factorial()` function.

> Disclaimer: I'm not planning on maintaining/updating this repo. I'm personally not invested in either Rust or Mojo! This is just quick, slapped together comparison that works on my Apple M3 with [Mojo](https://developer.modular.com/download), [Rust Nightly](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and XCode (for disassembly) installed.

## Benchmark

- [Mojo](./src/recursive-mojo.mojo)
- [Rust](./src/bin/recursive-rust.rs)
- [Rust using Vec::with_capacity()](./src/bin/recursive-rust-vec_with_capacity.rs)
- [Rust min sized binary](./src/bin/recursive-rust-no_main.rs)
  - Just threw this in as some of my projects use `#![no_main]` to reduce the binary size and startup time
  - Reading the disassembly is waayyyy easier, I wish Mojo had something similar.

## Usage (terminal)
