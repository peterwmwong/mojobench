Comparing Rust and Mojo compiler's ability to optimize away store/loads.

Originally benchmarking the TCO/TCE performance claims in [Mojo vs. Rust: is Mojo ðŸ”¥ faster than Rust ðŸ¦€ ?](https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust) ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240215183318/https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-vs-rust-is-mojo-faster-than-rust)) (see [`main` branch](https://github.com/peterwmwong/mojobench/tree/main)).

> Disclaimer: I'm not planning on maintaining/updating this repo. I'm personally not invested in either Rust or Mojo! This is just quick, slapped together comparison that works on my Apple M3.

## Setup

- [Mojo](https://developer.modular.com/download)
- [Rust Nightly](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine?tab=readme-ov-file#with-cargo-linux-macos-windows)
- XCode (for generating disassembly)

## Benchmark

- [Mojo](./src/store-load-mojo.mojo)
- [Rust](./src/bin/store-load-rust.rs)

## Usage (terminal)

> ./build.sh
